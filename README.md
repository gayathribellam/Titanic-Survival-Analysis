# Titanic Survival Analysis

This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to identify factors that influenced passenger survival and builds machine learning models to predict survival outcomes.

## Problem Statement
Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on demographic and socio-economic features.

## Approach
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering (Deck extraction, FamilySize, IsAlone)
- Logistic Regression and Random Forest models
- Model comparison and interpretation

## Results
- Logistic Regression Accuracy: ~82%
- Random Forest Accuracy: ~82%
- Feature engineering had a greater impact than model complexity

## Key Insights
- Gender and passenger class were the strongest predictors
- Deck location significantly influenced survival
- Family structure affected evacuation outcomes

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
